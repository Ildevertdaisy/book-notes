MongoDB => a document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in semi-structured BSON format
query language => a language used to retrieve and manipulate data in MongoDB, based on methods rather than SQL
find() => A MongoDB query method for finding and selecting documents matching simple or complex criteria
insertOne() => A MongoDB query method that inserts a new document into the collection
insertMany() => A MongoDB query method that inserts an array of documents into the collection
updateOne() and updateMany() => MongoDB query methods that update one or more documents according to some criteria
deleteOne() and deleteMany() => MongoDB query methods that delete documents from the collection
MongoDB shell => A command line interface for interacting with a MongoDB server
ObjectId => A unique identifier assigned to each document in MongoDB, represented as a 12-byte value
BSON => A binary-encoded serialization of JSON-like documents, used by MongoDB for storing data


insertOne() => method for creating new documents in MongoDB
insertMany() => method for inserting many documents at once in MongoDB
updateOne() => method for updating the first encountered document with the data provided in the fields
updateMany() => method for updating multiple documents with a specific criteria
$set => operator for updating existing properties in MongoDB
$inc => operator for incrementing the value of a field in MongoDB
replaceOne() => method for replacing a document in MongoDB
upsert => parameter for updateOne() method, creates a new document if it doesn't exist.
atomic operation => property of MongoDB, ensures that the first update to reach the server is applied.
ID => using the document's ID is generally recommended when updating single documents.

insertOne() => method for creating new documents in MongoDB
insertMany() => method for inserting multiple documents in MongoDB
updateOne() => method for updating the first encountered document with the data provided in the fields
updateMany() => method for updating many documents
deleteMany() => method for deleting multiple documents based on a filter
deleteOne() => method for deleting a single document based on a filter
drop() => method for deleting a collection and all documents in it.

Cursors => A cursor is a MongoDB object that enables you to perform operations on the results of a query, such as limiting the number of results, ordering by one or more keys, and skipping records. The find() method returns a cursor, but the actual iteration through the cursor is executed in a particular and customized way through the use of a language driver.

Chaining => Chaining is a technique that enables a developer to apply several operations on a cursor and return a fine-tuned result set. It's similar to jQuery or D3.js, it allows to chain multiple methods on cursor like sort, limit, and projection to fine-tune the query results.

Aggregation Framework => MongoDB aggregation framework is a powerful tool that enables developers to offload some of the computing burden of making calculations and aggregations of varying complexity to the MongoDB server. It's especially useful for building analytics charts showcasing prices, years, brands, and models.


MongoDB: A database management system that uses a document-oriented model to store data
insertOne(): A method used in MongoDB to create new documents in a database
insertMany(): A method used in MongoDB to create multiple new documents in a database at once
updateOne(): A method used in MongoDB to update the first encountered document in a database
updateMany(): A method used in MongoDB to update multiple documents in a database
replaceOne(): A method used in MongoDB to replace a document in a database
upsert: A parameter in updateOne() method that allows to check whether the document to be updated exists and then update it, but in the case that no such document exists, the method will create it.
deleteMany(): A method used in MongoDB to delete multiple documents in a database
drop(): A method used in MongoDB to delete an entire collection
Cursor: An object returned by MongoDB's find method that enables us to perform some standard database operations on the returned documents
Chaining: A technique in MongoDB that allows us to apply several operations on a cursor and returning a fine-tuned result set.
Aggregation framework: A feature in MongoDB that enables us to perform data processing in different stages or steps and retrieve sets of documents from a collection
Pipeline: A concept in MongoDB aggregation framework which is an alternative way to retrieve sets of documents from a collection
Aggregate: A method in MongoDB that performs the aggregation pipeline and takes a list of stages as a parameter
$match: A stage in MongoDB's aggregation framework that is used to include only a subset of the entire collection
$group: A stage in MongoDB's aggregation framework that is used to group documents by a specific key
Accumulator operators: Functions in MongoDB's aggregation framework such as average, count, sum, maximum, minimum, etc. that can be used to perform calculations and aggregations of varying complexity.
