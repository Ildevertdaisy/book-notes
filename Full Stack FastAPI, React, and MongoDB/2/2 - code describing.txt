use carsDB => The "use carsDB" command in MongoDB is used to switch the current database to a different database on the MongoDB server. In this case, the current database will be switched to a database named "carsDB". If the specified database does not exist, MongoDB will create a new database with that name.

show collections => The "show collections" command in MongoDB is used to display a list of all the collections in the currently selected database. A collection in MongoDB is a group of documents and it is equivalent to a table in a relational database. This command will show the names of all the collections available in the currently selected database.

db.cars.find({year:{'$gt':2015},price:{$lt:7000},brand:'Ford'}).pretty() => The "db.cars.find({year:{'$gt':2015},price:{$lt:7000},brand:'Ford'}).pretty()" command in MongoDB is used to retrieve all documents from the "cars" collection in the current database that match the specified query, with the year greater than 2015, price less than 7000 and brand is Ford, it also makes the output more readable by formatting it with indentation.

db.cars.find({brand:'Ford',make:'Fiesta'},{year:1,km:1,_id:0}).sort({'year':1}).limit(5) => The "db.cars.find({brand:'Ford',make:'Fiesta'},{year:1,km:1,_id:0}).sort({'year':1}).limit(5)" command in MongoDB is used to retrieve all documents from the "cars" collection in the current database that match the specified query, with the brand is Ford and make is Fiesta, and only displaying the year and km fields, excluding the _id field, in ascending order of year and limiting the results to 5 documents.

db.cars.insertOne({'brand':'Magic Car','make':'Green Dragon', 'year':1200}) => The "db.cars.insertOne({'brand':'Magic Car','make':'Green Dragon', 'year':1200})" command in MongoDB is used to insert a new document, in this case with brand 'Magic Car', make 'Green Dragon' and year 1200, into the "cars" collection in the current database.

db.cars.insertMany([{brand:'Magic Car',make:'Yellow Dragon',year:1200},{brand:'Magic Car',make:'Red Dragon',legs:4}]) => The "db.cars.insertMany([{brand:'Magic Car',make:'Yellow Dragon',year:1200},{brand:'Magic Car',make:'Red Dragon',legs:4}])" command in MongoDB is used to insert multiple documents, in this case, one with brand 'Magic Car', make 'Yellow Dragon' and year 1200 and another with brand 'Magic Car', make 'Red Dragon' and legs 4, into the "cars" collection in the current database.

db.cars.updateOne({make:'Fiesta'},{$set:{'Salesman':'Marko'}}) => The "db.cars.updateOne({make:'Fiesta'},{$set:{'Salesman':'Marko'}})" command in MongoDB is used to update one document from the "cars" collection in the current database that matches the specified filter, in this case make is 'Fiesta', by setting the 'Salesman' field value to 'Marko'.

db.cars.updateMany({make:'Fiesta'},{$inc:{price:-200}}) => The "db.cars.updateMany({make:'Fiesta'},{$inc:{price:-200}})" command in MongoDB is used to update many documents from the "cars" collection in the current database that matches the specified filter, in this case make is 'Fiesta', by incrementing the value of the 'price' field by -200.

db.cars.deleteMany({brand:'Magic Car'}) => The "db.cars.deleteMany({brand:'Magic Car'})" command in MongoDB is used to delete multiple documents from the "cars" collection in the current database that matches the specified filter, in this case brand is 'Magic Car'.

db.cars.drop() => The "db.cars.drop()" command in MongoDB is used to delete a collection, in this case "cars" collection from the current database. This command will also remove all the indexes associated with the collection.

let fiesta_cars = db.cars.find({'make':'Fiesta'}) => The "let fiesta_cars = db.cars.find({'make':'Fiesta'})" command in MongoDB is used to assign the documents that match the specified filter, in this case make is 'Fiesta', to a variable called "fiesta_cars" from the "cars" collection in the current database.

db.cars.find({year:2015},{brand:1,make:1,year:1,_id:0,price:1}).sort({price:1}).limit(5) => The "db.cars.find({year:2015},{brand:1,make:1,year:1,_id:0,price:1}).sort({price:1}).limit(5)" command in MongoDB is used to retrieve all documents from the "cars" collection in the current database that match the specified query, where the year is 2015, and only displaying the brand, make, year, and price fields, excluding the _id field, in ascending order of price and limiting the results to 5 documents.

db.cars.aggregate([{$match: {brand:"Fiat"}}]) => The "db.cars.aggregate([{$match: {brand:"Fiat"}}])" command in MongoDB is used to retrieve all documents from the "cars" collection in the current database that match the specified filter, in this case brand is "Fiat" using the aggregate pipeline function, which allows to filter, group and manipulate data in a more efficient way.

db.cars.aggregate([{$match: {brand:"Fiat"}}, {$group:{_id:{model:"$make"},avgPrice: { $avg: "$price"} }}]) => The "db.cars.aggregate([{$match: {brand:"Fiat"}}, {$group:{_id:{model:"$make"},avgPrice: { $avg: "$price"} }}])" command in MongoDB is used to retrieve all documents from the "cars" collection in the current database that match the specified filter, in this case brand is "Fiat" using the aggregate pipeline function, which allows to filter, group and manipulate data in a more efficient way, the command here is grouping the documents by the make field and calculating the average price for each make.

db.cars.aggregate([{$match:{brand:"Opel"}}, {$project:{_id:0,price:1,year:1,fullName: {$concat:["$make"," ","$brand"]}}},{$group:{_id:{make:"$fullName"},avgPrice:{$avg:"$price"} }}, {$sort: {avgPrice: -1}},{$limit: 10}]).pretty() => The "db.cars.aggregate([{$match:{brand:"Opel"}}, {$project:{_id:0,price:1,year:1,fullName: {$concat:["$make"," ","$brand"]}}},{$group:{_id:{make:"$fullName"},avgPrice:{$avg:"$price"} }}, {$sort: {avgPrice: -1}},{$limit: 10}]).pretty()" command in MongoDB is used to retrieve all documents from the "cars" collection in the current database that match the specified filter, in this case brand is "Opel" using the aggregate pipeline function, which allows to filter, group, project and manipulate data in a more efficient way, the command here is filtering by brand, projecting a new field fullName that concatenates make and brand, grouping by the fullName field and calculating the average price for each fullName, sorting the result in descending order by average price and limiting the result to 10 documents, it also makes the output more readable by formatting it with indentation.
